This is a simple social media app created using Next.js 14 as the framework, Clerk for user authentication, Mongodb as the backend database for storing user and post information, and Firebase as the database to store pictures posted. Currently, users can post (and delete the posted) pictures (no larger than 10 megapixels), view other users' posts, follow (and unfollow) them, as well as like and comment on others' posts. As this is currently only available only large devices like computers, I certainly hope to make it viable on small devices too someday, as well as implement more interactive functions like chatting.
